## Project Overview

In todayâ€™s competitive banking industry, understanding why customers leave, or "churn," is more critical than ever. This analysis aims to pinpoint essential demographic, financial, and behavioural factors that indicate customer churn and assess credit card usage.By understanding these factors influencing churn, banks will be able to enhance customer experiences, create retention strategies, and cultivate a loyal customer base, in turn contributing to their long-term stability and growth.

## About the Dataset

The datasets for this analysis were obtained from Kaggle, a widely used platform known for its extensive collection of public datasets. 

The dataset comprises of two files, each capturing distinct aspects of customer information. **CustomerInfo.csv** contains basic identification details, including `CustomerId` and `Surname`. **Bank_Churn.csv** is the primary file, covering customer demographics (such as age, gender, and location), financial information (credit score, balance, and estimated salary), and indicators of engagement, including `Active_Customer` (showing if a customer is active or inactive) and `Credit_Card_Holder` (indicating whether a customer has a credit card). The file also includes a `Churn` status to identify if a customer has left the bank.
